# Covid Management System - Patient Information System

This project is a database management system built using WampServer, designed to manage patient information, hospital locations, and hospital details. The database is structured into three main tables: `Patient`, `Area`, and `Hospital`.The objective of the project is to find the nearby hospital of the patient,so it is easy and safe to admit the patient in the time of lockdowns.

## Database Tables

### 1. Patient
The `Patient` table stores all the relevant information about the patients in the system.



### 2. Area
The `Area` table holds information about the geographical location of hospitals.


### 3. Hospital
The `Hospital` table contains detailed information about hospitals in the system.
